I am excited to have the opportunity to apply for a job at MealPal.
While, I know that my technical skills and experience are apt to qualify me for the Data Analyst role,
as it is outlined within the job post. After researching your company,
I feel it is my tenacity, quick wit, creativity and passion for Data Analytics as well as solving problems with data
that would put me in the best possible position to be an asset to your company 
and a strong contributor to the Data Analysis team. I look forward to speaking with you in 
greater detail about the benefits that I could bring to MealPal.
Thank you for your consideration. 

Regards,

Dan Temkin
